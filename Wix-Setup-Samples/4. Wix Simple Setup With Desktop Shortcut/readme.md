#### Let's get started

Code to look for is as below:
```sh
<ComponentGroupRef Id="ComponentGroupDesktopShortcut" />
```

Let wix know we have a ComponentRef named ```ComponentGroupDesktopShortcut```
```sh
<Directory Id="DesktopFolder" Name="DesktopFolder" />
```
Let wix know we need to access ```DesktopFolder``` and create shortcut with our application name ( ```$(var.Name)``` is variable having our Application name defined in the same file).

```sh
<Fragment>
    <!--Desktop Shortcut-->
    <ComponentGroup Id="ComponentGroupDesktopShortcut">
      <Component Id="ComponentDesktopShortcut" Guid="*" Directory="DesktopFolder" >
        <Shortcut Id="AppDesktopShortcut"
                  Name="$(var.Name)"
                  Description="$(var.Description)"
                  Directory="DesktopFolder"
                  Target="[#Sample_Application.exe]"
                  WorkingDirectory="INSTALLFOLDER"/>
        <!--Remove desktop shortcut on uninstall-->
        <RemoveFolder Id="DesktopFolder" On="uninstall"/>
        <RegistryValue Root="HKCU" Key="Software\$(var.Manufacturer)\$(var.Name)" Name="installed" Type="integer" Value="1" KeyPath="yes" />
      </Component>
    </ComponentGroup>
</Fragment>
```
Fragment with ```ComponentDesktopShortcut``` component, ```AppDesktopShortcut``` shortcut with application logo, ```WorkingDirectory``` tell's were to look for executable file in installed computer file system and ```Target``` tell's to look for file id "Sample_Application.exe".

```RemoveFolder``` tag tell wix that this shortcut neet to be removed on ```uninstall```.

We also do a  registery entry using tag ```RegistryValue``` at ```Software\Microsoft\$(var.Manufacturer)\$(var.Name)``` registry path.
