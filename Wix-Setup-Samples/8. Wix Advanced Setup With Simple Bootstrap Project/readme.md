#### Let's get started

Code to look for is as below:
```sh
<?define Logo = "Resources\logo.ico" ?>
```

Defined ```Logo``` variable with ```logo.ico``` image from Resources folder

```sh
<BootstrapperApplicationRef Id="WixStandardBootstrapperApplication.HyperlinkLicense">
    <bal:WixStandardBootstrapperApplication LicenseUrl="" LogoFile="$(var.Logo)" SuppressOptionsUI ="yes" SuppressRepair="yes"/>
</BootstrapperApplicationRef>
```

```LicenseUrl ``` is kept empty such that no license is displayed for bootstrapper setup.
```LogoFile ``` is logo for bootstrapper setup and not for the application.
```SuppressOptionUI ``` removes option button allowing user to select installation loaction from bootstrapper setup project.

```sh
<PackageGroupRef Id="NetFx452Web" />
```
```NetFx452Web```Installs .Net Framework 4.5.2 using web installer, for more option see Wix documentation at http://wixtoolset.org/documentation/manual/v3/customactions/wixnetfxextension.html

```Add Setup from previous project 7. Wix Simple Complete Setup With UI Image Banners. to reference```
```sh
<MsiPackage DisplayName="$(var.Name)" SourceFile="$(var.Wix Simple Complete Setup.TargetPath)" Compressed="yes" Vital="yes"/>
```
```Above code will install main setup created in previous project 7. Wix Simple Complete Setup With UI Image Banners.```
