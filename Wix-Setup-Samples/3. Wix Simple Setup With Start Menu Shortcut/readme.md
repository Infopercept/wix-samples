#### Let's get started

Code to look for is as below:
```sh
<ComponentRef Id="ApplicationShortcut" />
```

Let wix know we have a ComponentRef named ```ApplicationShortcut```
```sh
<Directory Id="ProgramMenuFolder">
    <Directory Id="ApplicationProgramsFolder" Name="$(var.Name)" />
</Directory>
```
Let wix know we need to access ```ProgramMenuFolder``` and create directory with our application name ( ```$(var.Name)``` is variable having our Application name defined in the same file).

```sh
<Fragment>
    <DirectoryRef Id="ApplicationProgramsFolder">
      <!--Create application shortcut in Program Menu-->
      <Component Id="ApplicationShortcut" Guid="*">
        <Shortcut Id="ApplicationStartMenuShortcut" Name="$(var.Name)" Description="$(var.Description)" Icon="Logo.ico" Target="[#Sample_Application.exe]" WorkingDirectory="INSTALLFOLDER" />
        <!--Remove application shortcut from Program Menu on uninstall-->
        <RemoveFolder Id="ApplicationProgramsFolder" On="uninstall" />
        <!--Create application registry entry-->
        <RegistryValue Root="HKCU" Key="Software\Microsoft\$(var.Manufacturer)\$(var.Name)" Name="installed" Type="integer" Value="1" KeyPath="yes" />
      </Component>
    </DirectoryRef>
</Fragment>
```
Fragment with ```ApplicationShortcut``` component, ```ApplicationStartMenuShortcut``` shortcut with application logo, ```WorkingDirectory``` tell's were to look for executable file in installed computer file system and ```Target``` tell's to look for file id "Sample_Application.exe".

```RemoveFolder``` tag tell wix that this shortcut neet to be removed on ```uninstall```.

We also do a  registery entry using tag ```RegistryValue``` at ```Software\Microsoft\$(var.Manufacturer)\$(var.Name)``` registry path.
