#### Let's get started

Code to look for is as below:
```sh
<Package InstallerVersion="200" Compressed="yes" InstallScope="perUser" InstallPrivileges="limited" Description="$(var.Name)" Manufacturer="$(var.Manufacturer)" />
```

```InstallScope``` tell wix that we want installation to be ```perUser```
```InstallPrivileges="limited"``` tell wix that setup do not need admin privilege to install the application. 

```sh
 <!--Fragment with details of installation directory-->
  <Fragment>
    <Directory Id="TARGETDIR" Name="SourceDir">
      <Directory Id="LocalAppDataFolder">
        <!-- Create a folder inside program files with Company Name-->
        <Directory Id="ROOTDIRECTORY" Name="$(var.Manufacturer)">
          <!-- Create a folder inside Company Name folder with Product Name-->
          <Directory Id="INSTALLFOLDER" Name="$(var.Name)">
            <Directory Id="DesktopFolder" Name="DesktopFolder" />
          </Directory>
        </Directory>
      </Directory>
      <!--Create application folder in Program Menu-->
      <Directory Id="ProgramMenuFolder">
        <Directory Id="ApplicationProgramsFolder" Name="$(var.Name)" />
      </Directory>
    </Directory>
  </Fragment>
```

Directory Id is changed to ```LocalAppDataFolder``` to install application at LocalAppDataFolder.
