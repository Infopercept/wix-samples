#### Let's get started

Basic XML tags:
```sh
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
```
```sh
<Wix xmlns="http://schemas.microsoft.com/wix/2006/wi" />
```
```sh
<Product Id="*" Name="Wix_Simple_Setup" Language="1033" Version="1.0.0.0" Manufacturer="Your Company Name" UpgradeCode="8a83ac1e-fd2e-4737-bd75-257f10e0d7a9" />
```
Notes: 
```Product Id = "*" ``` here "\*" will generate a new GUID for us.
```Language="1033" ``` is telling our program that we need a Setup in "English" language.
```Manufacturer``` is for your company name.
```UpgradeCode``` its ```important``` and it should be a unique value for your setup. Do not change it if you release a updated version/ new version of your setup. Changing it will install a new copy of software with same name and version.

```sh
<MajorUpgrade DowngradeErrorMessage="A newer version of [ProductName] is already installed." />
```
```[ProductName]``` will be replaced by itself with the value and this message will be dispalyed to user if a newer version of setup is already installed on user machine.

```sh
<Fragment> </Fragment>
```
```Fragment``` can be used to ease the organising wxs file and improve readability and maintainability. They are building block of creating an installer database in WiX. Fragment becomes an immutable, atomic unit which can either be completely included or excluded from a product. The contents of a Fragment element can be linked into a product by utilizing one of the many *Ref elements.

```sh
<Directory Id="TARGETDIR" Name="SourceDir">
	<Directory Id="ProgramFilesFolder">
		<Directory Id="INSTALLFOLDER" Name="Wix_Simple_Setup" />
	</Directory>
</Directory>
```
```Directory``` tag is used for creating folders and also installing folder with in another directory. IN above code its targeting the ```ProgramFilesFolder``` Where application will be installed.

```sh
<ComponentGroup Id="ProductComponents" Directory="INSTALLFOLDER" />
```
``` ComponentGroup``` Groups together multiple components ```<Component /> ```
